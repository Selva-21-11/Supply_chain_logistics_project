# Supply Chain & Freight Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + Python)

This project is a comprehensive dashboard created to analyze freight cost, lead time, and predict future freight trends using a combination of *Power BI* and *Python* (via embedded scripts). It is structured into *four sheets*:

1. *Freight Cost Overview*
2. *Lead Time Overview*
3. *Freight Predictive Analysis*
4. *Predictive Python Visuals*

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Preparation

- *Data Source: **MySQL Database*
- *Connection*: Connected directly to MySQL using Power BI's native database connector.
- *Tools Used*: Power Query for transformation and cleaning.
- *Steps Performed*:
  - Queried and loaded data from multiple MySQL tables.
  - Merged and cleaned datasets in Power Query.
  - Created relationships between:
    - Order List
    - Freight Cost
    - Product Info
    - Other dimension tables.

### 2. Calculated Columns & Measures

*Key Calculated Columns:*
- Freight Cost = Unit freight charges calculated per row.
- Lead Time = Date difference between dispatch and arrival.
- Any other derived columns used for visuals.

*Key DAX Measures:*
- Total Freight Cost
- Freight Cost per KG
- Average Lead Time
- On-Time Delivery Rate
- Warehouse Utilization
- Prediction Error Amount
- Total Predicted Freight Cost

## Dashboard Pages & Visuals

### *Freight Cost Overview*
Provides a high-level summary of freight costs.

*Visuals:*
- *Bar Chart*: Freight Cost by Carrier.
- *Scatter Plot*: Freight Cost vs Lead Time.
- *Bar Chart*: Freight Cost per KG by Origin Port.
- *Cards*:
  - Total Freight Cost
  - Highest Freight Cost Carrier
  - Freight Cost per KG
- *Slicers*: Carrier, Order Date, Origin Port, Plant Code, Product ID.

### *Lead Time Overview*
Focuses on delivery performance and capacity.

*Visuals:*
- *Bar Chart*: On-Time Delivery % by Carrier.
- *Gauge*: Warehouse Utilization (Used vs Max).
- *Card KPIs*:
  - Average Lead Time
  - On-Time Delivery Rate
  - Minimum Lead Time Carrier
- *Slicers*: Carrier, Order Date, Origin Port, Plant Code, Product ID.

### *Freight Predictive Analysis*
Forecasts freight cost using Python and machine learning.

*Process:*
- Merged Order List and Freight Cost tables.
- Created a Python-powered table for predictive freight analysis using pandas, scikit-learn.

*Visuals:*
- *Line Chart*: Actual vs Predicted Freight Cost (Carrier-wise).
- *Table*: Carrier, Customer, Freight Cost, Predicted Cost, Prediction Error.
- *Cards*:
  - Total Predicted Freight Cost
  - Total Prediction Error
- *Slicers*: Carrier, Customer, Product ID.

### *Predictive Python Visuals*
Displays advanced Python machine learning visuals.

*Process:*
- Used scikit-learn to create regression model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor).
- Trained on historical freight data.
- Generated outputs used in previous pageâ€™s prediction.

*Visuals:*
- Model performance and regression plot.
- Additional charts built entirely with Python visuals embedded in Power BI.
